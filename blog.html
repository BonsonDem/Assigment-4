        The features in css3 allowed developed to code less than the previous version. Css3 enabled thing like user interface, box model, selectors, back grounds, border, media queries, transforms, text-effect, multiple column layout, animations.
        Css3 does change the older css code but add on it. It allows developers to style HTML easier. And has fewer lines of code.
